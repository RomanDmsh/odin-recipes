			<li>
				4 (Waitrose and M&S sell brioche-style burger buns) brioche burger buns,

			</li>
			<li>2 vine tomatoes, sliced to serve</li>
			<li>8 slices emmental</li>
			<li>sliced to serve gherkins</li>
			<li>to serve frilly lettuce</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>SWEET AND SOUR ONIONS</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2 tbsp red wine vinegar</li>
			<li>2 tsp golden caster sugar</li>
			<li>½ red onion, very finely sliced</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>SECRET BURGER SAUCE</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2 heaped tbsp mayonnaise</li>
			<li>2 tsp French’s American mustard</li>
			<li>
				1 tbsp gherkins, very finely diced plus 1 tsp vinegar from the jar
			</li>
			<li>1 tbsp ketchup</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Mix the burger sauce ingredients together. If you have time, leave the
				sauce ingredients for a few hours or even make it the day before.
			</li>
			<li>
				To make the sweet and sour onions, mix the vinegar and sugar in a bowl
				and toss the sliced onions in it. Stir now and again while you make the
				burgers.
			</li>
			<li>
				Put the mince in a bowl. Grate the onion on the course side of a box
				grater.The tougher outer layers will refuse to grate, so just discard
				these. You just want the grated purée. Add the grated onion to the mince
				bowl along with a splash of Worcestershire sauce, celery salt, and
				chilli flakes. Mix everything with your hands and divide into 8 equal
				portions.
			</li>
			<li>
				Flatten each portion into a very thin patty.They will spring back in the
				pan so make them much thinner than you think you should.
			</li>
			<li>
				Heat a non-stick frying pan on a high heat.Turn the oven to 200C/fan
				180C/gas 6. Fry the patties for 2 minutes each side.You won’t be able to
				get all 8 in one pan, so as you finish, transfer them to a baking
				tray.When you have 8, top each with a square of cheese and put in the
				oven for 2-3 minutes until the cheese melts.
			</li>
			<li>
				Put some sauce on each bun base. Add lettuce and a couple of slices of
				tomato. Stack up 2 patties with cheese, then add sauce, the onions and
				gherkins. Add more sauce, the bun tops and skewer each to hold it
				together.
			</li>
		</ol>
